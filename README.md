# RandomNameGenerator
 An Random Japanese Name Generator written in c++ as an Console Application

***Note:*** the Dakuten character **"chi"** is displayed as **"xji**" to not get confused with the d
Dakuten character **"shi"**, when writing in Kana/Kanji

## Planned Features:
* conversion to an C# .Net Framework application including an GUI
* User able to select **"StartWith"**, **"Middle"** and **"EndWith"** characters
* User able to select words the name should include (for example "aoi")
* Displaying the generated name(s) in *Kana/Kanji*
* ... more to come
